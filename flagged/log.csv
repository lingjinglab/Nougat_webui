Because the EMIME test set has paired speech utterances with Chinese and English, we are able to calculate the ASV score among the generated speech (hyp), the source speech (src), as well as the target speech (tgt), resulting in 3 settings (tgt vs. src, hyp vs. src, and hyp vs. tgt). From Table 4 we can find that: (1) For Chinese(\rightarrow)English, the ASV score of VALL-E X Trans significantly outperforms that of the conventional speaker embedding based S2ST system (Baseline), demonstrating the superiority of our model in terms of maintaining the source speaker’s voice. (2) The ASV score has similar values when the generated speech (hyp) is compared with the source speech (src) and the target speech (tgt), and it is far away from the upper bound (tgt vs. src) for the English(\rightarrow)Chinese direction, which suggests that the cross-lingual voice transferability still has the improvement space. (3) When directly generating speech from the ground-truth (oracle) text which degrades into cross-lingual TTS, the ASV score does not increase notably, indicating that voice transferability is less affected by the quality of translation.</p>
<p>Translation QualityTable 4 also shows the translation performance of VALL-E X Trans. Note that ASR-BLEU with oracle target text as the input of VALL-E X can be seen as the upper bound when translations are exactly correct. With oracle target text as input, VALL-E X Trans can achieve the performance of about 84(\sim)87 BLEU scores, which also reflects the high performance of our neural codec language model. For Chinese(\rightarrow)English, VALL-E X Trans achieves higher BLEU over the baseline (30.66 vs. 27.49), demonstrating the end-to-end speech-to-phoneme translation is more effective against the conventional cascaded speech-to-text translation when applying to S2ST task.</p>
<p>Speech NaturalnessWe also evaluate the Naturalness with the open-source NISQA [Mittag and Moller, 2021] for S2ST outputs. As shown in the last column of Table 4, compared to the baseline, VALL-E X Trans achieves a better naturalness score (3.54 vs. 3.44), which shows that VALL-E X can generate more natural target language speech than the baseline.</p>
<p>Human EvaluationWe randomly sample 56 translation pairs13 to perform a human evaluation using SMOS and MOS metrics for both Chinese(\rightarrow)English and English(\rightarrow)Chinese directions. Table 5 lists the results of VALL-E X Trans as well as the Chinese(\rightarrow)English baseline. We use MOS (from 1 to 5 scores) instead of CMOS because the translated content may be different among models, which is not suitable for CMOS evaluation. For speaker similarity evaluation, VALL-E X Trans outperforms the baseline with 1.06 SMOS scores (4.12 vs. 3.06), demonstrating its superior ability to model speaker property of the proposed VALL-E X. Note that this value still can be improved since it is still far from the SMOS between the source speech prompt and ground truth (4.91). For speech quality, our VALL-E X slightly outperforms the baseline in Chinese(\rightarrow)English S2ST in terms of MOS score (3.87 vs. 3.81).</p>
